<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Welcome to <strong>BambooCraftMC</strong>! By accessing or playing on our Minecraft server (<a href="https://mc.bamboocraftmc.net">mc.bamboocraftmc.net</a>), you agree to follow these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before continuing.</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to play on BambooCraftMC. If you are under 13, you may only participate with verified parental or guardian consent. By playing, you confirm that you meet these requirements.</p>

<h2>2. Mojang Account Requirement</h2>
<p>You must use a <strong>legitimately purchased Minecraft: Java Edition account</strong> from Mojang/Microsoft. Pirated or “cracked” clients are not permitted. You are solely responsible for the security of your account.</p>

<h2>3. Server Conduct</h2>

<h2>4. Payments and Donations</h2>
<p>Purchases made through our store (such as ranks, perks, or other in-game benefits) are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>. Once a payment is processed, it cannot be reversed, even if your account is later banned, muted, or otherwise restricted.</p>
<p>We plan to use <strong>Tebex</strong> as our official payment platform to handle all store transactions securely.</p>

<p>BambooCraftMC, its staff, and affiliates are not responsible for any loss of data, account access, or damages resulting from server downtime, data corruption, or player actions.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

<h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the server after changes are posted means you agree to the updated terms.</p>

<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the <strong>United States</strong>. By using BambooCraftMC, you consent to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts for any disputes that may arise.</p>
