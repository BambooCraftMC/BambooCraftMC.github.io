        <h2>Owner Accountability and Leadership Review Policy</h2>

        <div class="rule">
            <p>
                This policy is intended to provide a clear and fair process for
                addressing situations in which an owner believes that another
                owner may no longer be capable of fulfilling their leadership
                responsibilities in a healthy, responsible, or effective manner.
            </p>

            <p>
                If one owner determines that another owner is unwell, inactive,
                or otherwise unable to properly lead the community, that owner
                may formally initiate a leadership review. This determination
                must be made in good faith and for the purpose of protecting the
                stability and well-being of the community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon initiation of this review, the owner being reviewed will
                have their roles and ownership permissions temporarily removed.
                This action is not an immediate judgment or permanent removal,
                but rather a precautionary measure to ensure that no harm or
                misuse of authority occurs during the review process.
            </p>

            <p>
                After roles are removed, the community will be informed and a
                vote will be held among eligible members. The purpose of this
                vote is to determine whether the reviewed owner should be
                reinstated to full ownership or formally demoted from their role.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the community vote results in demotion, a structured and
                transparent election process will be conducted to select a new
                owner. All eligible members will be given the opportunity to
                participate in the election to ensure fairness and legitimacy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The outcome of the vote and any resulting ownership changes will
                be final and enforced in order to preserve trust, accountability,
                and long-term stability within the community.
            </p>
